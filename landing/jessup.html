<body>
    <p>Jessup is the world's largest moot court competition, with participants from roughly 700 law schools in 100
        countries and jurisdictions. The Competition is a simulation of a fictional dispute between countries before the
        International Court of Justice, the judicial organ of the United Nations. One team is allowed to participate
        from every eligible school. Teams prepare oral and written pleadings arguing both the applicant and respondent
        positions of the case.</p>
